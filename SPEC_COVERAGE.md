# Spec coverage matrix

Coverage of `docs/Spec.md` (Kappa Language Specification) by this
implementation, at section granularity, for all Parts I–X plus
Appendix T. Statuses:

* **Implemented** — behaviour conforms within the noted limits and is
  exercised by tests.
* **Partial** — a meaningful, documented subset conforms; the rest is
  missing or approximated (notes say which).
* **Parsed-only** — the surface syntax is accepted by the lexer/parser
  (and usually carried in the AST), but elaboration rejects it with
  `E_UNSUPPORTED` or ignores it.
* **Not implemented** — no meaningful support.

Test references are paths under `tests/conformance/` (the in-tree
suite, 91/91 passing) or `examples/`. The external black-box corpus
tally is in `tests/external-results.md` and TESTING.md.

## Part I. Language Contract and Conformance

| Section | Status | Notes / tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §1 Design principles | Partial | Diagnostics are typed records rendered to text (§1, §3.1.8) — `src/Kappa/Diagnostic.hs`. No typed compiler artifacts/query layer (§1.2): the pipeline is a batch compiler. §1.2A (no syntax-shaped decisions post-resolution) is followed in spirit: fixity is resolved before elaboration, names by semantic identity. |
| §2 Profiles, gates, versions, conformance | Not implemented | One fixed profile; no feature-gate machinery. `unicode-names` (§2.1A) is permanently inactive; the lexer emits the gate-aware error for Unicode numeric suffixes (§6.1.6). Backend-lacking-capability rejection (§2.1) is approximated only by the test harness classifying such fixtures unsupported. |
| §3.1 Diagnostic records, codes, families | Partial | Structured records with severity, stage, code, `kappa.*` family, primary span, notes, helps (`Kappa.Diagnostic`, with one shared text renderer for the CLI and the harness). Stable symbolic codes (§3.1.2). Missing: sub-span labels, §3.1.1A related origins and machine payloads (no producer/renderer — deliberately not modeled), machine-readable registry CLI (§3.1.2A), JSON payloads (§3.1.9), fix-its (§3.1.6 — notes/help only), repair ranking (§3.1.7), provenance frames (§3.1.5A), explanations (§3.1.13). |
| §3.1.14/§3.1.14A Recovery | Partial | Parse-level recovery to declaration boundaries: `parser/recovery.kp` (two errors reported, checking continues). Recovery granularity is declaration-level only: a parse error *inside* a `do` block abandons the whole block, so the remaining block lines re-parse as (failing) top-level declarations and the introducer can produce a spurious `E_UNRESOLVED_NAME: 'do'` — a cascade of mislocated follow-on errors after the genuine one. The lexer stops at the first lexical error by design (documented delta; multi-error lexical fixtures in the external corpus under-count). |
| §3.2 Standard diagnostic families | Partial | The families used by implemented features carry spec spellings (e.g. `kappa.name.unresolved`, `kappa.type.mismatch`); families for unimplemented subsystems (borrows, macros, bridges, Python backend, …) are absent. |
| §3.3 Path-/borrow-sensitive failure diagnostics | Not implemented | Requires borrow/quantity checking. |
| §4 Unsafe and debug facilities | Not implemented | No `unsafe`/`debug` gating, `unhide`/`clarify`, termination escapes, or audit ledger. |

## Part II. Surface Syntax and Names

| Section | Status | Notes / tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §5.1 Identifiers | Implemented | ASCII identifiers. §5.1A Unicode name profile: not implemented (gate inactive). |
| §5.2 Keywords | Partial | All keywords lex as identifiers and are recognized contextually. Query/handler keywords — `group`, `by`, `order`, `skip`, `take`, `distinct`, `join`, `yield`, `into`, `when`, `handle`, `deep` — are ordinary identifiers outside their clause contexts, including bare and parenthesized argument position, parameter binders, and assignment targets (`lexer/soft-keyword-identifiers.kp`): they terminate an application-argument run only inside a comprehension body (plus `by` inside a `decreases` measure), and `deep` only when immediately followed by `handle`. Residual delta: keywords that continue an enclosing construct after an expression or start a statement — `then else elif in with case except finally do where if match while for for? let let? var return break continue defer import export instance derive is as on using captures decreases` — still terminate an unparenthesized argument run context-insensitively, so a bare reference to a variable with one of those names in argument position misparses (parenthesized: parse error; bare: statement split, cascading per the §3.1.14A do-block recovery delta above). See KNOWN_SPEC_ISSUES.md #11. |
| §5.3 Comments | Implemented | Line comments; comment-only lines never affect layout. |
| §5.4 Whitespace, indentation, continuation | Implemented | Python-style INDENT/DEDENT at bracket depth zero; logical-line indentation is the first token's column. Tabs rejected: `lexer/tab-in-indent.kp`, `lexer/tab-in-source.kp`. Bad dedent: `parser/bad-dedent.kp` (`E_LAYOUT_BAD_DEDENT`). |
| §5.5.1 Operator tokens, longest match | Implemented | Longest-match-first incl. `let?`/`for?`, `?.`, `?:`, `?name` holes, `~=`, `<[`, `]>` (see KNOWN_SPEC_ISSUES.md for a consequence). |
| §5.5.1.1 Operator sections | Implemented | Left/right/bare sections; `(infix op)`/`(prefix op)` forms parse. `(op e)` is unary prefix application when a `prefix` fixity for `op` is in scope (so `(-1)`/`(- a)` are negation per §28.2.3's `(-) : prefix 80`, with chain precedence preserved: `(- 1 + 2)` is `negate 1 + 2`); `(prefix -)` denotes `negate` (§5.5.1, §6.1.4): `fixity/paren-negation.kp`. Sections usable in check mode. |
| §5.5.2 Fixity declarations | Implemented | Block-scoped; parser emits flat chains, the resolver re-associates once fixities are known. `fixity/user-fixity.kp`; missing fixity → `E_OPERATOR_NO_FIXITY` (`fixity/no-fixity.kp`). |
| §5.5.3 Infix gating | Partial | The §28.2.3 default fixity table is provided (`Kappa.Resolve.defaultFixities`); per-name infix-permission gating beyond fixity presence is not modeled. |
| §6.1 Numeric literals | Implemented | Radix forms (`literals/radix.kp`), fraction/exponent vs suffix split (`literals/float-exponent.kp`, `literals/suffix-term.kp`), §6.1.5 typing/defaulting: integer literals through `FromInteger` (`literals/defaulting.kp`), float literals through `fromFloat : Double -> t` when the expected type has a `FromFloat` instance, defaulting to `Double` (`literals/fromfloat.kp`). §6.1.6 Unicode suffixes: gate-off error. §6.1.3: `eqDouble` is raw-bit equality; `floatEq` is IEEE equality. |
| §6.2 Boolean literals | Implemented | Prelude `Bool`/`True`/`False`. |
| §6.3.1–6.3.3 Basic/raw/multiline strings | Implemented | Escapes (`lexer/bad-escape.kp`, `lexer/unterminated-string.kp`), `#"…"#` raw forms, multiline fixed dedent. |
| §6.3.4 Prefixed strings + interpolation | Partial | The `f` handler with `${expr}`/`$name` interpolation works end to end (`run/string-interp.kp`, `examples/todo.kp`). Other handlers (`re`, `b`, `type`) lex/parse but elaborate to `E_UNSUPPORTED`. |
| §6.3.5 Conventional type-prefix handler | Not implemented | See KNOWN_SPEC_ISSUES.md (lookahead interaction). |
| §6.4 Unicode scalar literals | Implemented | `LitScalar`; `eqScalar`/`showScalar` primitives; `Char = UnicodeScalar` alias (§28.5). |
| §6.5 Prefixed quoted literals | Parsed-only | Plain scalar literals work; `g`/`b` handler forms → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. |
| §6.6 Unit and tuples | Implemented | `Unit`; tuples as positional records, tuple patterns (`match/tuple-record-patterns.kp`), punned tuples. |
| §7.1 Ordinary lexical lookup | Implemented | Scope-stack lookup during elaboration; `names/unresolved.kp`, `names/duplicate.kp`. §7.1.1 kind-qualified name expressions: not implemented. |
| §7.2 Same-spelling families, type facet | Partial | Type positions prefer the type facet of a head name (`Check.hs` "type-facet lookup"), recursively: any application checked against a universe re-enters the type-facet path, so nested parenthesized type arguments like `Wrap (Wrap Integer)`, `List (Wrap Integer)`, `Pair (Wrap Integer) Bool` elaborate correctly (`types/nested-same-spelling.kp`). Residual: a same-spelling name in a *non-sort* type argument position (e.g. an argument checked against `Type -> Type`) still resolves in the term facet; unreachable in practice since higher-kinded data parameters are themselves unsupported. The full data-family/static-member story is absent. |
| §7.3 Dotted name resolution | Partial | Projection, method-style member access, safe navigation; module-qualified dotted paths only within the loaded-suite module graph. |
| §7.5–7.6 Module values, reified static-object facets | Partial | Reified module objects carry identity tags and survive rebinding (`let M = module Api` … `M.answer`), with member access through rebindings and records; kind-qualified static-object expressions (`(module a).b`); data-facet preference with constructor fallback for applied type heads; manifest-binding gating — a binding whose ascribed (widening) signature is not manifestly the static object forgets static identity for downstream dotted lookup (§7.6 "otherwise well-formed" rule). Not: projection-declaration facets, effect-label facets, trait facets in constraint position (`let C = trait Sized`). |
| §8 Modules, imports, exports, visibility, opacity | Partial | Multi-file directory suites compile in import order with cycle detection (§8.2; `Kappa.Pipeline`). Import statements select scope; export lists, visibility/opacity enforcement, URL imports, and import hashes are not implemented. |

## Part III. Declarations and Static Language

| Section | Status | Notes / tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §9 Declarations and definitions | Partial | Signature + `let` pairs, `data`, `type` aliases, `trait`, `instance`, `fixity`, `import`; two passes (headers then bodies) per the preceding-signature recursion rule (§9.2, §15.16); a signature may precede its definition at a distance, including signatures whose types reference signature-less `let`s (deferred elaboration). Multi-line signatures continue across lines after a trailing arrow or `forall`-dot (§5.4 continuation). `derive`, `pattern` (active patterns), projection declarations, top-level splices: Parsed-only → `E_UNSUPPORTED` (`tests/conformance/shape/decl-kinds.kp` counts declaration kinds). |
| §10 ADTs and type aliases | Implemented | Parameterized `data` with named constructor fields, constructor-arity checking (`application/ctor-arity.kp`), named constructor application with field defaults (§10.1.1: a missing label is permitted iff the parameter has a default, which is elaborated at the application site — `records/ctor-field-defaults.kp`, `records/ctor-field-default-missing.kp`; defaults referring to earlier fields of the same constructor are not supported), transparent aliases (`Int`, `UIO`, …). Same-spelling constructor/type families work in nested type positions (`types/nested-same-spelling.kp`; see §7.2 row for the residual non-sort-position limitation). Data parameters must have kind `Type`: a higher-kinded parameter such as `(f : Type -> Type)` is accepted syntactically but its application in a field type fails (`E_APPLICATION_NON_CALLABLE`). GADT-style indexed results: "GADT-lite" — the constructor result is unified with the scrutinee type at match (§17.1.2 approximation). |
| §11.1 Universes | Partial | `Type`, `Type0..n`, `*` spellings; cumulativity `Type m ≤ Type n` for `m ≤ n` (§11.1.1). No universe polymorphism; records/Pi types currently land in `Type 0`. |
| §11.2 Classifiers | Not implemented | No `Row`/`Label`/intrinsic classifier names. |
| §11.3 Implicit binders, universalization | Partial | §11.3.3 approximated: free ASCII-lowercase heads in top-level signatures, instance heads, and instance premises that resolve to no global are implicitly universalized as erased implicit `Type` binders (`application/lambda-hof.kp` uses `apply2 : (b -> a -> b) -> b -> a -> b`). Block-local signatures are not universalized. |
| §11.4 Propositions | Partial | §11.4.1 propositional `(=)` with `refl` (`equality/refl-conversion.kp`); `(lhs = rhs)` implicit goals decided by conversion (`1 + 1 = 2` by refl; `5 - 3` via `subDefined` proof: `equality/sub-proof.kp`; symbolic `x - y` fails `E_IMPLICIT_UNSOLVED`: `equality/sub-unknown.kp`). §11.4.2 boolean-to-type coercion: not implemented. |
| §12 Functions, binders, quantities | Partial | All five portable interval quantities (`0`, `1`, `ω`, `≤1`, `≥1`) parse and are carried on core Pi binders, where they participate in type identity (§31.1). **Usage counting is not enforced** — quantity-violation diagnostics (§3.2.5) never fire. Symbolic quantities approximate to `ω`. |
| §12 Borrowing, regions, captures | Parsed-only | `&`, `&[region]`, capture clauses parse into the AST; no borrow checking, region inference, or capture checking. `inout`/`~` call-site arguments → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. |
| §13.1–13.2 Records | Implemented | Closed records: literals, punning (`records/punning.kp`), projection (`records/basics.kp`, missing field → `E_RECORD_PROJECTION_MISSING_FIELD`), functional patch `.{ }` (§13.2.5; unknown field → `E_UNKNOWN_FIELD`, `records/patch-unknown-field.kp`), rest patterns. Canonical lexicographic field order with source-order initializer evaluation (§31.4). Not: open rows / `:=` row extension, dependent records, nested patch paths, projection-section updates. |
| §13.1.3, §13.3 Variants / closed unions | Implemented | `(\| A \| B \|)` types, expected-type-directed injection incl. literals (`variants/injection.kp`), widening as a no-op, closed-union match (`variants/closed-union.kp`, missing member → error: `variants/missing-member.kp`), `Int?` Option sugar (`variants/option-sugar.kp`). Member identity = canonical rendered member type after alias normalization (§31.3). Not: open variant rows. |
| §13.4–13.5 Sealed packages, existentials | Parsed-only | `seal`/`exists`/`open` → `E_UNSUPPORTED` (`unsupported/seal.kp`, `unsupported/exists.kp`). |
| §14 Traits | Partial | User traits, instances, premise instances (`instance Eq a => Eq (List a)`: `traits/premise-instance.kp`), default members (`traits/default-member.kp`). Resolution: local implicit context, then global instance search with a unique-candidate coherence rule (§14.3.1) — ambiguity → `E_INSTANCE_INCOHERENT` (`traits/incoherent.kp`), no candidate → `E_IMPLICIT_UNSOLVED` (`traits/missing-instance.kp`). Supertrait premises (§14.1.4) are enforced at instance declarations: missing evidence → `E_SUPERTRAIT_UNSATISFIED` (`traits/supertrait-unsatisfied.kp`); satisfiable from global instances or the instance's own premises, including depth-bounded transitive supertrait conformance paths (`traits/supertrait-satisfied.kp`). Higher-kinded traits: instance heads whose arguments are type *constructors* (`instance Functor List`) check the head arguments against the trait-constructor parameter types, backing the §28.2 container trait stack (`prelude/containers.kp`); kind-like implicit goals (`Type -> Type`) are never evidence-searched, and unification decomposes first-order meta spines and rigid spines (`?f a ~ G a`). Not: supertrait conformance paths during *use-site* implicit resolution (evidence of `MyOrd a` does not yield `MyEq a` at member call sites), associated type members (`Out : Type`, §14.2.1), associated static members (§14.3.4), named instances, instance search-depth control (§14.3.5 beyond a recursion bound). |
| §15 Totality, termination, unfolding | Partial | §15.1 split between total-certified and conversion-reducible is modeled: only reducible definitions δ-unfold during conversion. Structural-descent verification for direct recursion (§15.3 minimum): `recursion/structural.kp` (clean), `recursion/non-structural.kp` (`W_TERMINATION_UNVERIFIED`), recursion without a preceding signature → `E_RECURSION_NO_SIGNATURE` (`recursion/no-signature.kp`). `decreases` clauses parse in all portable forms — bare measure, parenthesized tuple, `by` relation, and `structural x` (`recursion/decreases-parses.kp`) — and are recorded but not verified against §15.4/§15.8; §15.10–15.17 lanes not implemented. |

## Part IV. Expressions, Control Flow, and Effects

| Section | Status | Notes / tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §16.1 Application, spine, implicits | Implemented | Application-spine implicit insertion (§16.1.7.1) with postponed trait goals; named function application and named-argument blocks (§16.1.7); non-callable application → `E_APPLICATION_NON_CALLABLE` (`application/non-callable.kp`). |
| §16.1.1 Dotted forms | Partial | Projection, method sugar, safe navigation `?.` (§16.1.1.2). Projector/accessor descriptors (§16.1.5–16.1.6): not implemented. |
| §16.1.2 Elvis `?:` | Partial | `a ?: b` elaborates as Option scrutiny when the left operand is Option-typed (a dedicated `EElvis` node: `Some x ?: b ↦ x`, `None ?: b ↦ b`); general null-union / flow-typed left operands beyond `Option` follow the variant story and are not special-cased. |
| §16.1.3 Short-circuit booleans | Implemented | `(&&)`/`(||)` over `Thunk Bool` with suspension binder sugar (`(thunk x : T)` ⇒ `Thunk T`, §16.2.4) and `force (thunk e) ↦ e` reduction. |
| §16.1.4 / §16.1.8 Subsumption, equality transport | Partial | Variant widening and alias-transparent conversion at application boundaries; automatic transport insertion limited to conversion-decided `(=)` goals. |
| §16.2 Lambdas | Implemented | Typed/untyped binders (including multi-argument unannotated lambdas against polymorphic HOF parameters: `application/lambda-hof.kp`), implicit binders, suspension sugar. |
| §16.3 Implicits, holes | Partial | §16.3.3 ladder: local implicit context → global instance search → boolean-proposition normalization for `(lhs = rhs)` goals decided by conversion. Named holes lex; no interactive hole reporting. |
| §16.4 Conditionals, flow typing | Partial | `if`/`elif`/`else` expressions (else required in value position: `run/if-expr-needs-else.kp`); statement `if` without `else` in do-blocks (`run/if-no-else.kp`). Flow-sensitive refinement: `if p is C` constructor tests refine the scrutinee's constructor set in the branch (§16.4.1), composed through `&&`/`\|\|` (§16.4.2) and transported across stable aliases `let q = p` (§16.4.3), enabling field projection on the refined multi-constructor subset (`refinement/is-projection.kp`, `refinement/is-disjunction-alias.kp`). Not: `not`-composition, `match`-arm refinement outside `if`, §16.4.4 positive lower-bound checking. |
| §17 Patterns, matches | Partial | Constructor, literal, tuple, record, variant, or-patterns (`match/or-patterns.kp`), guards (`match/guards.kp`), nesting (`match/nested-ctor.kp`), parenthesized-operator constructor heads (`((::) x xs)`). Exhaustiveness (§17.1) for closed ADTs, `Bool`, variants, records, tuples; literal scrutinees require a catch-all (`match/literal-patterns.kp`, `match/not-exhaustive.kp`, `match/bool-missing-case.kp`). Active patterns (§17.3): Parsed-only → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. `impossible` branches, erased-scrutinee discrimination, guard evidence: not implemented. |
| §18.1 Effects, fibers | Not implemented | No effect rows, handlers (`unsupported/handle.kp`), fibers, or structured concurrency. `effect` declarations parse → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. |
| §18.2–18.8 do-blocks, kernel | Partial | The §18.8 completion kernel is implemented structurally (`CDo` in core, executed by `Kappa.Interp`): completion records, LIFO `defer` (`run/defer-lifo.kp`), `return` (`run/return-early.kp`), `break`/`continue`, loop `else` only on no-break (`run/loop-else-break.kp`, `run/for-break-continue.kp`), `while` (`run/while-var.kp`), `for`, `let pat <- e` monadic bind, `let? … else` (`run/letq-else.kp`), `var` cells as `Ref` with auto-deref reads (§18.6.1), `!e` splices (§18.3). Labeled loops with `break@L`/`continue@L` (§18.2.5) including compile-time label resolution (`E_LABEL_UNRESOLVED`; `labels/*.kp`); unlabeled `break`/`continue` outside any loop body of the do-scope → `E_BREAK_OUTSIDE_LOOP` (§18.6; `do/continue-outside-loop.kp`). Resolution is confined per do-scope: a first-class do value (`let inner = do …`) starts a fresh scope, so neither unlabeled nor labeled `break`/`continue` written inside it can target a loop of the scope it is later spliced into — both are rejected at compile time (`do/break-in-first-class-do.kp`), a loud-conservative delta from §18.8.10 (see IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md "Completion is not first-class"). The only carrier is `IO e` — do-blocks are not generic over user monads. `using` resource binds, `return@label` (§18.5.1), `defer@label` (§18.7) → `E_UNSUPPORTED`; labels on `do`/lambda/`match` are accepted and inert (consumers all rejected; see IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md). |
| §19 Errors, try/except/finally | Partial | Typed IO errors: `raise`/`throwError`/`catchError`, `try`/`except`/`finally` statements (`run/try-except-finally.kp`, `examples/todo.kp`). `try match` and `bracket`-style resources: not implemented. |
| §20 Collections, ranges, comprehensions | Partial | List literals and list comprehensions (`[for x in xs yield e]`, with `if`/`let` clauses). Map literals (including the empty `{}` — `unsupported/map-literal.kp`), set literals, set/map comprehensions, group/order/join query clauses → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. Ranges `..`/`..<`: fixity exists, no prelude implementation. |

## Part V. Metaprogramming and Staging

| Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §21 Syntax, macros, elab, reflection | Not implemented | Quotation/splice forms parse → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. |
| §22 Derivation-shape reflection | Not implemented | `derive` declarations parse → `E_UNSUPPORTED`. |
| §23 Staged code | Not implemented | |

## Part VI. Dynamic Values, Boundaries, and Interop

| Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §24 Dynamic values | Not implemented | No `Dynamic`, no runtime representations registry. |
| §25 Boundary contracts, bridges | Not implemented | |
| §26 FFI, host bindings | Not implemented | |
| §27 Backend / runtime capability profiles | Not implemented | Tree-walking interpreter only; the harness classifies backend- or capability-requiring fixtures as unsupported (§T.8). See `examples/README.md` for the consequence (no network demo). |

## Part VII. Standard Library Reference

| Section | Status | Notes / tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §28.1 Implicit prelude import | Partial | Every file compiles against `std.prelude` (builtins + embedded source, `Kappa.Prelude`), including the fixed unqualified constructor subset (`True`…`refl`). It cannot be disabled (see KNOWN_SPEC_ISSUES.md). |
| §28.2 Normative minimum contents | Partial | Provided: `Void`/`Unit`/`Bool`/`Ordering`/`Option`/`Result`/`List`, aliases `Int`/`Float`/`Char`/`UIO`, `not`/`(&&)`/`(||)` over `Thunk`, the `Show`/`Eq`/`Ord` traits + comparison operators with instances for every §28.2-mandated base type this implementation has — `Eq`: `Unit`, `Bool`, `UnicodeScalar`, `String`, `Integer`, `Nat`, `Double`, `Ordering`; `Ord`: `Bool`, `UnicodeScalar`, `String`, `Integer`, `Nat`, `Double`, `Ordering`; `Show`: `Unit`, `Bool`, `UnicodeScalar`, `String`, `Integer`, `Nat`, `Double`, `Ordering` (aliases `Int`/`Float`/`Char` share them transparently; `traits/base-instances.kp`) — numeric traits per §28.2.1–28.2.3 (`Add`, `Mul`, `Negatable`, `CheckedSub`/`Div`/`Mod` with proof-carrying `(-)`/`(/)`/`(%)`, `FromInteger` for `Nat`/`Integer`/`Double`, `FromFloat` for `Double` incl. literal elaboration), `(++)`, `show`/`print`/`println`/`printString`/`printlnString`, `pure`/`raise`/`throwError`/`catchError`, `identity`, `(\|>)`/`(<\|)`, list functions (`map`, `filter`, `foldl`, `foldr`, `listAppend`, `concatMap`, `listLength`), `orElse`, `newRef`/`readRef`/`writeRef`, `floatEq`. Container/traversal trait stack (the §28.2 "functorial/monadic" and "containers and traversals" minimum): `Functor`/`Foldable`/`Filterable`/`FilterMap`/`Applicative`/`Traversable`/`Monoid`/`Monad`/`Zero`/`One`/`FromString`/`EuclideanSemiring`/`Releasable` with `List`/`Option`/`String`/`Nat`/`Double` instances; member-style `map`/`filter`/`foldr`/`foldl`/`foldMap`/`filterMap`/`traverse`/`(>>=)`; `sequence`, `subtract`/`divide`/`modulo`, `summon`, `(++)` over `Monoid` (`prelude/containers.kp`); opaque `Duration`/`Instant`/`STM`/`TVar` type builtins (§18.1 types only — no runtime operations); `std.testing.failNow`. Missing: the mandated instances for types this implementation lacks (`Byte`, `Bytes`, `Grapheme`, `Rational`), `Eq`/`Ord`/`Show` instances for `List`/`Option`/`Result`, equality combinators (`sym`, `trans`, `cong`, `subst`, `pathInd`, `absurd`), `witness`, fibers/timers, arrays/sets/maps, ranges, `re`/`b`/`type` handlers, `bracket`. |
| §28.2.3 Standard fixities | Implemented | `Kappa.Resolve.defaultFixities`. |
| §29 Required standard modules | Not implemented | None of `std.atomic`, `std.supervisor`, `std.hash`, `std.unicode`, `std.bytes`, `std.debug`, `std.config`, `std.build`. |

## Part VIII. Core Semantics and Identity

| Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §30.1–30.2 Elaboration, KCore | Partial | Bidirectional elaboration to a pragmatic KCore subset (`Kappa.Core`): de Bruijn terms, Pi with icit+quantity, saturated constructors, match, canonical records/variants, literals, metas. Deliberate delta: do-blocks stay structured (`CDo` + `KItem`) rather than lowering to the spec's completion-kernel combinators; the interpreter executes the kernel semantics directly (§18.8). |
| §31.1 Definitional equality | Partial | NbE conversion: β, δ (conversion-reducible definitions only, §15.1), ι (match/if on known scrutinees), record/variant canonical-form equality, suspension reduction, function η. Quantities participate in Pi identity. Conversion is fuel-bounded; fuel exhaustion is only ever reported as "not equal" (sound, incomplete). |
| §31.2 Erasure | Partial | Erased (quantity-0) implicit constructor parameters are dropped from runtime payloads; full erasure pipeline absent. |
| §31.3 Variant runtime representation | Implemented | Tags are canonical renderings of alias-normalized member types, so `Int` and `Integer` members coincide. |
| §31.4 Record canonicalization | Implemented | Lexicographic canonical field order; initializers still evaluate in source order via a `CLet` chain. |
| §31.5 Elision of mutable state | Not implemented | `var` cells are real `Ref`s at runtime. |
| §32 Runtime semantics | Partial | §32.1 strict, call-by-value, left-to-right evaluation; §18.8 completion kernel with exit actions run exactly once; typed IO failures via catch/finally. No fibers, STM, handlers, timers. |
| §33 Content-addressed identity | Not implemented | |

## Part IX. Compiler, Tooling, Config, and Build

| Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §34 Pipeline, IRs, tooling, lowering | Not implemented | No KFrontIR/KBackendIR, no queries, no dumps. The internal pipeline is parse → resolve → elaborate → interpret (`Kappa.Pipeline`), exposed as `kappa (check\|run\|test)`. |
| §35 Config mode | Not implemented | |
| §36 Build system | Not implemented | |

## Part X. Tooling, IDE, and Interactive Semantic Services

| Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §37 LSP/IDE services | Not implemented | |

## Appendix T. Test harness

| Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §T.2–T.8 | Partial | Single-file inline tests, directory suites (`suite.ktest`/`main.kp`/direct directory argument, multi-file compilation in import order), the §T.3 directive subset listed in TESTING.md, inline `--!!` markers, unsupported-classification per §T.8. Supported `x-` extension directives per §T.3/§T.1: `x-assertEval`, `x-assertEvalErrorContains`, `x-assertDeclDescriptors`, `x-assertTraitMembers` (subjects resolve in the directive file's own module per §T.6; values render precedence-aware). `mode analyze`/`compile`, backends, capabilities, stdin/args, dump assertions: classified unsupported. |
