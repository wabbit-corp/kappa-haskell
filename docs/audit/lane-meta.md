## §2 Language profiles, feature gates, versions, conformance (CORE, Part I)

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §2.1 | MUST determine active language profile + feature-gate set before successful elaboration | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | There is a fixed implicit profile (kappa-v1, `unicode-names` off). No source pragma / manifest / flag can change it; cannot probe a *second* profile. | Single hard-coded profile; no profile-selection surface, but a fixed-profile impl is internally consistent. |
| §2.1 | Parser recognition ≠ acceptance; gated construct fails with feature-gating diagnostic | IMPLEMENTED+TESTED | `/tmp/probe/uni.kp` `let π = 3` → `error[E_FEATURE_INACTIVE] (kappa.feature.gated): unquoted Unicode identifiers require the 'unicode-names' feature gate (Spec §2.1A)`; exit 1. Parser tokenizes, lexer rejects. | Correct family `kappa.feature.gated`. |
| §2.1 | Feature-gate diagnostic MUST identify: construct, owning gate, **active language profile**, inactive/stronger-gate, **provenance of gate settings**, implication path, repair | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | Observed diag names construct (Unicode ident) + owning gate (`unicode-names`) + inactive status + repair note ("use a backtick identifier"). It does NOT name the active profile (`kappa-v1`) nor the provenance of the setting, and carries no structured payload (Diagnostic record has only code/family/sev/span/message/notes — `src/Kappa/Diagnostic.hs:49`). | The active-profile + provenance facts are absent; collapses into the §3.1.1 no-JSON gap (no machine-readable place to carry them). |
| §2.1A | `unicode-names` is a standardized optional gate; kappa-v1 does NOT imply it | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§2.1A para "The `kappa-v1` portable language profile does not imply `unicode-names`") | Gate is inactive by default and rejected; backtick identifiers still available. | Correctly inactive-by-default per §2.1A. |
| §2.2 | Version terminology (Kappa v1) | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | Non-normative; impl targets v1. | n/a |

## §4 Unsafe and Debug Facilities (CORE classification, Part I)

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §4.1 | Safe portable subset excludes `unhide`/`clarify`/`assertTerminates`/`assertReducible`/`assertTotal`/`unsafeAssertProof`/`std.debug`; these remain part of the language spec | MISSING (no clause makes §4 optional) | `unhide`/`clarify` are *parsed* (`Parser.hs:872`) but never build-gated. The rest are absent: `/tmp/probe/at.kp` `assertTerminates let loop : Int = loop` → `E_EXPECTED_SYNTAX_TOKEN` (parse error, not recognized); `assertReducible` likewise; `unsafeAssertProof` → `E_NAME_UNRESOLVED`. `std.debug` (§29.6) absent from prelude. | §4 says these are "part of the language specification … classified as unsafe/debug" — it does NOT say an implementation MAY omit them. They are *recognized syntax forms* that must at least produce the §4.2 gating diagnostic, not a generic parse error. See gap list. |
| §4.2 | Build-level gating; violations are compile-time errors naming the offending form AND the disallowing build setting (`allow_*`) | MISSING | No `allow_unhiding`/`allow_clarify`/`allow_assert_*`/`allow_unsafe_assert_proof`/`allow_debug_introspection` anywhere in src (grep empty). `unhide`/`clarify` parse but are never gated → in package mode (default: all false, §4.2) a program using them is silently accepted at parse, not rejected. | The mandated §4.2 diagnostic (identify form + setting) does not exist. |
| §4.3 | `unhide`/`clarify` semantics + error if build setting disabled / definition inaccessible | MISSING | Parsed into `ImportItem` flags (`Parser.hs:872`) but no semantic effect and no gating error probed. | |
| §4.4 | `assertTerminates`/`assertReducible`/`assertTotal` escapes + δ-reduction/recording semantics | MISSING | Not recognized (parse error above). | |
| §4.5 | `unsafeAssertProof` prelude helper + interface recording | MISSING | `unsafeAssertProof` unresolved; not in prelude. | |
| §4.6 | Backend-specific surface escapes excluded from safe subset | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§4.6 "If an implementation provides such a facility") | No backend escape facility is offered; §4.6 is conditional on *providing* one. | Not providing one is conforming. |
| §4.7 | Unsafe/debug audit ledger + `auditModule/auditPackage/auditArtifact` structured queries (MUST) | MISSING | No audit ledger, no audit query, no `unsafe*` machinery anywhere in src. | Predicated on §4.1–§4.5 features existing; since those are absent, the ledger is vacuously empty but the *audit-query surface MUST* is still unmet. Tied to separate-compilation artifacts (likely profile-adjacent), so ranked lower. |

## Appendix T — Standard test harness (CORE for this lane; `src/Kappa/TestHarness.hs`)

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §T.1 | If claiming standard-harness support, MUST accept the syntax and satisfy the behavior | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED / partial SPEC-CONFLICT | TESTING.md claims Appendix-T support but classifies several **standard** directives `unsupported` (see §T.5.1/§T.5.3 rows). | The harness is mostly faithful but the structured-diagnostic/stage-dump downgrade is not a sanctioned `unsupported` trigger (§T.8). |
| §T.2 | Three test forms: single-file inline; directory suite (any dir with ≥1 `.kp`); incremental step suite | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | `--suite` form is correct (one dir = one suite root, `runTestSuitePath`). But the recursive walker `runTestPathAt False` treats a *nested* dir containing `.kp` files but no `suite.ktest`/`main.kp` as a **collection of independent single-file tests**, not one §T.2 directory suite (`src/Kappa/TestHarness.hs:1773-1793`, `isSuiteRoot` requires `suite.ktest`/`main.kp` or top-level). | Probe: `kappa test tests/conformance/staging` (dir of `.kp`, given non-top-level under a tree walk) does not compile them as one suite. Convenience-layer divergence; correct when pointed at a real suite. Minor. |
| §T.3 | `--!` directive lines; `--!!` inline markers (`.kp` only, after source text); `x-` extensions; **unknown standard directive / malformed / ill-typed arg = harnessError**; `x-` unsupported = unsupported (never silently ignored) | IMPLEMENTED+TESTED (one sub-gap) | `/tmp/ht/unknown.kp` `assertTotallyMadeUp` → HARNESS-ERROR. `/tmp/ht/mal.kp` `assertErrorCount notanumber` → HARNESS-ERROR. `--!!` with no preceding source → HARNESS-ERROR. Unknown `x-foo` → UNSUPPORTED. | Sub-gap: §T.5.1 "purely numeric codes are not valid" not enforced — see §T.5.1 row. |
| §T.4 | Config: `mode {analyze,check,compile,run}`, `packageMode`/`scriptMode`, `backend`, `entry`, `runArgs`, `stdinFile`, `dumpFormat`, `requires …`; capabilities `stageDumps/pipelineTrace/incremental/runTask` | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED + partial SPEC-CONFLICT | `mode check`/`run`/`compile` accepted; `analyze` → unsupported; `backend interpreter` accepted, foreign backend → unsupported for compile/run (`/tmp/ht/*`); `requires …` gating works; capabilities `runTask`+`pipelineTrace` met, `stageDumps`+`incremental` → unsupported. **BUT** `runArgs` and `stdinFile` are *standard config directives* and are classified `unsupported` (`TestHarness.hs:292-293`): `/tmp/ht/ra.kp` → `UNSUPPORTED (runArgs is not supported)`, `/tmp/ht/sf.kp` → `UNSUPPORTED (stdinFile is not supported)`. Per §T.8 `unsupported` is only for unmet `requires` or unsupported `x-` directives. | Downgrading standard config to `unsupported` is non-§T.8 conformant. `mode compile` is accepted with no real backend (`/tmp/ht/compile.kp` → PASS); arguably fine since interpreter is the backend, but `compile` PASS without any code-gen verification is a weak/empty pass. |
| §T.4 | Capability `stageDumps` not provided | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§T.4 makes unmet `requires capability` → unsupported; §34 stage dumps are profile-scoped — see §34 rows) | `requires capability stageDumps` → unsupported (`TestHarness.hs:303-305`). | Correct *when gated by `requires`*; the un-gated `assertStageDump` downgrade is the problem (see §T.5.3). |
| §T.5.1 | Diagnostic assertions: `assertNoErrors/NoWarnings/ErrorCount/WarningCount/Diagnostic/DiagnosticNext/At/Match/Family/ExplainExists`; `--!!` markers | IMPLEMENTED+TESTED | `/tmp/ht/ec.kp` assertErrorCount 1 → PASS; `/tmp/ht/ne.kp` assertNoErrors → PASS; `/tmp/ht/next.kp` assertDiagnosticNext → PASS; `/tmp/ht/match.kp` assertDiagnosticMatch (regex) → PASS; `/tmp/ht/fam.kp` assertDiagnosticFamily kappa.feature.gated → PASS; explain via `kappa explain` works. | Core diagnostic-code assertions faithful. |
| §T.5.1 | "Purely numeric codes are not valid standard-harness diagnostic codes" (so a numeric `<code>` is ill-typed → harnessError per §T.3) | SPEC-CONFLICT (minor) | `/tmp/ht/num.kp` `assertDiagnostic error 12345` → **FAIL** ("no diagnostic error[12345]"), not HARNESS-ERROR. The harness treats `12345` as a valid code. | Wrong classification; would falsely PASS if a diag with code "12345" ever existed. `parseDirective` does not validate code shape. |
| §T.5.1 | Structured diagnostic assertions: `assertDiagnosticPayload/Label/Related/Fix/FixCount/FixCompiles`, `assertSuppressedDiagnostic` (STANDARD directives) | SPEC-CONFLICT | All hard-coded to `unsupported` via `structuredUnsupported` (`TestHarness.hs:175-185, 458-459`): `/tmp/ht/payload.kp` → `UNSUPPORTED (… structured-diagnostic/stage-dump data this implementation does not produce)`; `/tmp/ht/supp.kp`, `/tmp/ht/fix.kp` likewise. These are NOT `x-` extensions and have no `requires` gate, so §T.8 does not permit `unsupported`. | Root cause: the Diagnostic record carries no payload/label/related/fix/suppression (`Diagnostic.hs:49`) and there is no JSON output (§3.1.1). The harness *downgrades* rather than *fails* — non-deceptive (never false-passes) but not §T.8-conformant. See gap list. |
| §T.5.2 | `assertType`, `assertDeclKinds`, `assertFileDeclKinds` | IMPLEMENTED+TESTED | `/tmp/ht/type.kp` assertType n Int → PASS; `/tmp/ht/sig3.kp` `n : Int` + `let n = 5` → assertDeclKinds signature, let → PASS; `declKind` mapping faithful (`TestHarness.hs:1726`). | `assertType` uses definitional equality of the resolved type. |
| §T.5.3 | `assertStageDump <checkpoint> equals <path>` (Chapter-34 checkpoint, JSON/sexpr canonical compare) | SPEC-CONFLICT (same shape as §T.5.1) | `/tmp/ht/stage.kp` `assertStageDump kfront equals expected.json` → `UNSUPPORTED` unconditionally (`structuredUnsupported`). Per §T.8 only `requires` / `x-` trigger `unsupported`. | Defensible iff §34 stage dumps are profile-scoped AND the directive is gated by `requires capability stageDumps` — but the harness downgrades even an UN-gated `assertStageDump`. The clean conformant behavior is `harnessError` ("`<checkpoint>` must name a valid compiler checkpoint" → none exist) OR require the `requires` gate. |
| §T.5.4 | Run assertions `assertStdout/StdoutContains/StderrContains/StdoutFile/StderrFile/ExitCode` (mode run) | IMPLEMENTED+TESTED | `/tmp/ht/run2.kp` `mode run` + `let main = 42` + `assertStdout "42"` → FAIL (got `42\n`) which proves the comparison runs; `assertStdout "42\n"` variant passes; `assertExitCode` reads the run exit code. Run executes via in-process interpreter (`runMainCapturedValue`). | Functional. Golden-file forms `assertStdoutFile/StderrFile` present in dispatch. |
| §T.5.5 | Trace assertions `assertTraceCount <event> <subject> <relop> <n>` over the portable trace; exactly one count per `(event,subject)`; non-portable names rejected | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | `/tmp/ht/trace.kp` `assertTraceCount parse file >= 1` → PASS. Trace recorded in `cuTrace` (parse/buildKFrontIR per file, lowerKCore per module — `Pipeline.hs:125,282`). Non-portable event/subject → harnessError. | Only `parse`/`buildKFrontIR`/`lowerKCore` are genuinely produced; `mode compile` *synthesizes* a `lowerKBackendIR`/module step from each `lowerKCore`/module (`TestHarness.hs:718`) — a fabricated-but-documented analog, not a false pass. Portable subset is small; most events never occur. |
| §T.6 | Suite behavior; **same config key twice with different values ⇒ suite ill-formed** | SPEC-CONFLICT (minor) | Only `mode` conflict is checked (`TestHarness.hs:679`). `/tmp/ht/conf.kp` `dumpFormat json` + `dumpFormat sexpr` → **PASS** (should be ill-formed/harnessError). | Other config keys (dumpFormat, backend, scriptMode/packageMode) are not conflict-checked. |
| §T.7 | Incremental step suites (`step0..`, `incremental.ktest`, cross-step asserts) | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§T.4 unmet `requires capability incremental`; §34 session reuse profile-scoped) | `runIncrementalDir` classifies the whole suite `unsupported` ("require capability 'incremental'"). `assertStep*` syntax validated then unsupported. | Defensible: §T.4 lists `incremental` as an optional capability and unmet `requires capability` → unsupported. |
| §T.8 | Result classification: pass/fail/unsupported/harnessError; `unsupported` ONLY for unmet `requires` or unsupported `x-` | SPEC-CONFLICT | The `unsupported` outcome is over-used: standard `runArgs`/`stdinFile` (§T.4), `assertDiagnosticPayload/Label/Related/Fix*/Suppressed` (§T.5.1), `assertStageDump` (§T.5.3) all map to `unsupported` with neither a `requires` gate nor an `x-` prefix. | This is the central harness-faithfulness defect; non-deceptive but out of spec. See gap list. |
| §T.9 | Determinism (no dependence on worker count, hash-table order, line endings) | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | Single-threaded; diagnostics carried in deterministic order; LF normalization in run assertions (`assertStdout` normalizes). No randomness probed. | Plausibly deterministic; not independently stress-tested for ordering. |
| §T.10 | P0 diagnostic alias conformance suite (SHOULD) | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | Non-normative SHOULD; many P0 codes exist in `src/Kappa/Explain.hs`. | Out of strict scope (SHOULD). |

## §21–§23 Macros / Elab / Derivation-shape / Staged code (partially implemented)

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §21.1–21.2 | Quotation `'{ }`, splice `${ }`, top-level splice `$( )`, Elab monad | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | AST nodes `EQuote/ESpliceInQuote/DTopSplice` (`Syntax.hs:260-415`); `tests/conformance/macros/*` and `/tmp/macro_*.kp` macro-stress check clean (300/600/1200 splice sites, linear time). | Surface + interpreter macro expansion works for the tested forms; full §21 reflection-query surface not exhaustively verified. |
| §22 | Derivation-shape reflection | UNCLEAR | `tests/conformance/deriving/*` exist and pass; depth of §22 reflection API not independently disproven. | Needs the derivation lane; not disproved here. |
| §23.2 | Staged code `.<e>.` / `.~c` escape | IMPLEMENTED-WEAKLY-TESTED | AST `ECodeQuote/ECodeEscape` (`Syntax.hs:261-262`); `tests/conformance/staging/{borrow-escape,code-pipeline,escape-outside-quote}.kp` all PASS individually. | Tested for the conformance fixtures only. |

## §24–§26 Dynamics / Boundary / FFI / Bridges

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §24 | Dynamic values / runtime representations | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (interpretation is sanctioned per scope rule; §1.1 boundary honesty applies only if a foreign connection exists) | No `Dynamic`/`toDynamic`/`fromDynamic` in src (grep empty). | No spec clause *mandates* a dynamic-value surface for a pure interpreter with no host boundary; §24 governs runtime representations that only matter at a boundary (§25/§26), which this impl does not cross. |
| §25 | Boundary contracts / bridge packages | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§25 is conditional on having a boundary; Appendix O frames graduality as roadmap) | Absent from src. | A frontend+interpreter with no foreign boundary has no §25 obligations to violate. |
| §26 | FFI / host bindings / native ABI / Kappa-to-Kappa bridges | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§36.28 host bindings are build-system/profile-scoped) | Absent from src. | No FFI surface offered; nothing to gate. |

## §27 Backend profiles & runtime capability profiles

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §27.1–27.5A | Native/JVM/CLR/wasm/js/python backend profiles | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§27.7: "A backend profile is conforming iff …" — backends are per-profile; an impl need not ship every profile) | No code generators in src; `backend <foreign>` → unsupported in harness. | §27.7 makes each backend independently conforming; interpretation is a sanctioned execution strategy (scope rule). |
| §27.6 | Runtime capability profiles (e.g. `rt-multishot-effects`) | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§2.1 backend-capability gates; §27.6 capability profiles are backend-scoped) | Capability gates are part of backend profiles; interpreter exposes none. | |
| §27.7 | Backend conformance (per-profile) | N/A (scope) | The clause itself that makes backends profile-scoped. | Cited above. |

## §34 Compilation pipeline / IR dumps / checkpoints

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §34.1.3–34.1.7 | Compiler observability (stage dumps/checkpoints) — "ordinary required tooling facilities … not unsafe/debug" (§4.1) | MISSING-or-PROFILE (UNCLEAR) | No checkpoint serialization; `assertStageDump` → unsupported; no `dumpFormat`/checkpoint emission. The harness's stage-dump downgrade rests on this absence. | §4.1 calls §34.1.3-§34.1.7 "ordinary required tooling facilities," which argues *against* full optionality. But §37.3 tiers IDE/tooling profiles and the scope rule treats the compiler-pipeline dump machinery as profile-scoped. Best read: dump *content* is profile-scoped, but the §T.5.3 harness directive should then `harnessError` on an unknown checkpoint, not silently `unsupported`. Flagged in §T.5.3. |
| §34.1.6A | Conformance-verification mode | UNCLEAR / PROFILE | Not implemented; no `kappa` subcommand for it. | Profile-scoped per scope rule (compiler-pipeline machinery). |
| §34.2–34.5 | KFrontIR / KBackendIR / runtime obligations / intrinsics | PARTIAL | KFrontIR error-tolerance exists (pipeline); KBackendIR/target lowering absent (no backend). | Backend IR is profile-scoped (§27.7). |

## §35 Config mode

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §35.1–35.13 | Config units / profiles / evaluator / provenance / `.kcfg` / `kappa.build.kp` | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§35 intro: config mode is selected "by role, file extension, command-line option, or embedding API" — a separate mode, not part of the ordinary compile pipeline) | No `.kcfg`/config-mode handling in CLI (only check/run/test/explain). | A frontend+interpreter that does not offer config-mode tooling is not running config units; §35 is a distinct evaluation profile. |

## §36 Build system

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §36.* | Manifest, build plan, lockfile, targets, providers, publish, etc. | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (build system is a separate tool layer; §36.28 host bindings, §36.30 bridges are profile-scoped; CLI is a single-file checker/runner) | No build-manifest parsing, no `kappa.build.kp` handling. | The language implementation (check/run/test) does not require the package build system; this is the build-tool profile. |

## §37 IDE / LSP / interactive semantic services

| § | requirement (short) | status | evidence/probe | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §37.3.1 | Tooling Core profile (analysis session, structured diagnostics, LSP, semantic protocol, …) — "minimum acceptable profile for a serious Kappa implementation" | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED for the *LSP/session surface* (§37.3 explicitly divides IDE support into conformance profiles; the scope rule tiers §37 IDE profiles) | No LSP server, no session model, no semantic queries in src. | BUT §37.3.1 lists "machine-readable structured diagnostics" as part of even the minimum profile — reinforcing that the no-JSON gap (anchored at §3.1.1, which is CORE) is real. The LSP/session machinery itself is profile-scoped. |
| §37.3.2–37.3.4 | First-Class / Broad-Compat / Syntax-Only client profiles | INTENTIONALLY-UNSUPPORTED (§37.3 profile tiers) | Not provided. | Profile-scoped. |

## Hostile overfitting sweep (findings)

Method: `grep -rn` over `src/` for fixture-name / path string matching, identifier
equality special-cases, and diagnostic "tolerances."

- **No fixture-name / path string matching found.** No references to `Fixtures`, the
  external corpus path, or fixture directory names in code paths (only in comments).
  The external driver lives in `tools/run-external-fixtures.sh` and uses the corpus
  purely as black-box inputs.
- **`assertDiagnosticCodes` alias matching (`TestHarness.hs` + `Explain.hs:requiredAliasTable`)**:
  matches only through §3.1.4 *required* portable aliases, in both directions; non-aliased
  codes are compared verbatim. This is a bounded, spec-anchored equivalence, NOT a free
  "tolerance" — verified by reading `requiredAliasTable`. Acceptable.
- **`assertEval` loose-list rendering (`TestHarness.hs:1107-1124, 1189-1194`)**: `assertEval`
  accepts EITHER the canonical rendering OR a corpus-compatible "loose cons" rendering
  (`Some 1 :: Nil` for `Some (1 :: Nil)`). This is a *tolerance*, but `assertEval` is a
  documented **nonstandard** compatibility directive (§T.1 permits nonstandard directives),
  not a standard-harness assertion — so it does not relax any spec-mandated check. Flag: it
  could mask a real precedence/printing bug in `assertEval`-based corpus tests. Low risk.
- **Type-checker "compatibility accommodations for the external corpus" (`Check.hs:2637, 2677`)**:
  (1) `IO a` is silently elaborated to `IO ?e a` by inserting a fresh metavariable when the
  head is the prelude `IO` and only one explicit arg is supplied; (2) `Array n elem` is
  accepted over the prelude `Array : Type -> Type` carrier via a phantom `__sizedOf` element.
  These are semantic special-cases motivated by passing another implementation's corpus.
  They are keyed to prelude globals (not fixture names) and are documented, but they are
  corpus-driven leniencies in the *type checker*, which is more concerning than harness-level
  tolerances. NOT in this lane's MUST set, but flagged for the type-system lane.
- **`divInt`/`modInt` zero-divisor and `intToNat` negative special-cases (`TestHarness.hs:1159-1166`)**:
  these are inside `assertEvalErrorContains` runtime-error *detection*, recognizing known
  prelude primitive failure shapes. Reasonable, bounded.

No code path was found that string-matches a fixture *name* to force pass/fail, and no
unimplemented assertion silently *passes* — the consistent failure mode is `unsupported`
(over-broad, but non-deceptive).

## Bounded perf check

Decl-scaling (`tools/gen-stress.sh`, `kappa check`, `/usr/bin/time -v`):

| decls | wall | maxRSS |
|---|---|---|
| 2000 | 0.21s | 33 MB |
| 4000 | 0.38s | 48 MB |
| 8000 | 0.73s | 77 MB |

Comprehension-pipeline stress (`tools/gen-comp-stress.sh`):

| comprehensions | wall | maxRSS |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | 0.41s | 38 MB |
| 400 | 0.72s | 74 MB |
| 800 | 1.38s | 82 MB |

Macro-expansion stress (`tools/gen-macro-stress.sh`):

| splice sites | wall | maxRSS |
|---|---|---|
| 300 | 0.28s | 35 MB |
| 600 | 0.30s | 41 MB |
| 1200 | 0.43s | 42 MB |

All three workloads scale **linearly** in time and memory; no superlinear blowup and
nothing approaching 1 GB. No perf gap.

## Legitimate gaps (ranked)

In-scope, spec-grounded, MUST/SHALL-level unsatisfied requirements, each disproved by a probe.
Profile-scoped items are excluded (see next section).

### 1. No machine-readable JSON diagnostic output — §3.1.1 (BLOCKER)

- **§**: §3.1.1 (lines 493–496: "A conforming implementation MUST support both: 1. a
  human-readable diagnostic renderer; and 2. machine-readable diagnostic output in JSON.";
  line 529: "the JSON output MUST expose fields observationally equivalent to" the record
  incl. `labels/fixes/related/payload/suppressed`).
- **Probe**: `kappa check --json /tmp/probe/uap.kp` → prints usage and exits (no `--json`
  flag exists). `grep -i 'aeson|json' kappa-haskell.cabal` → empty. All three CLI commands
  emit only `renderDiagnostic` (human prose) to stderr (`app/Main.hs:47,55`). The
  `Diagnostic` record (`src/Kappa/Diagnostic.hs:49`) has only code/family/severity/span/
  message/notes.
- **Expected vs actual**: spec requires a JSON rendering of the structured diagnostic
  record; actual = no JSON anywhere. (Also drives §3.1.5A provenance, §3.1.9 payloads, §2.1
  feature-gate provenance, and the Appendix-T structured-assertion downgrade.)
- **Severity**: BLOCKER (CORE Part I; §3 diagnostic contract is explicitly in-scope per the
  task's hard-MUST list).
- **Fix locus**: add a JSON encoder over `Diagnostic` in `src/Kappa/Diagnostic.hs` plus a
  `--json`/format flag in `app/Main.hs`; extend the `Diagnostic` record with labels/related/
  fixes/payload/suppressed fields (currently absent).

### 2. Appendix-T harness downgrades STANDARD directives to `unsupported` — §T.8 / §T.5.1 / §T.5.3 / §T.4 (MAJOR)

- **§**: §T.8 ("`unsupported` means one or more `requires …` preconditions were not
  satisfied, or the test used one or more **extension directives** unsupported by this
  harness") read against §T.5.1 (`assertDiagnosticPayload/Label/Related/Fix*/Suppressed`),
  §T.5.3 (`assertStageDump`), and §T.4 (`runArgs`, `stdinFile`) — all standard, none `x-`,
  none `requires`-gated.
- **Probe**: `/tmp/ht/payload.kp` (`assertDiagnosticPayload error E_FEATURE_INACTIVE /gate
  "unicode-names"`) → `UNSUPPORTED (… structured-diagnostic/stage-dump data this
  implementation does not produce)`. `/tmp/ht/stage.kp` (`assertStageDump kfront equals
  expected.json`) → `UNSUPPORTED`. `/tmp/ht/ra.kp` (`runArgs "a" "b"`) → `UNSUPPORTED
  (runArgs is not supported)`. `/tmp/ht/sf.kp` (`stdinFile in.txt`) → `UNSUPPORTED`.
- **Expected vs actual**: §T.8 does not authorize `unsupported` for un-gated standard
  directives. Spec-correct outcomes are either implement-and-evaluate, or — for the
  stage-dump checkpoint that does not exist — `harnessError` (§T.5.3 "`<checkpoint>` must
  name a valid compiler checkpoint"). Actual = blanket `unsupported`.
- **Severity**: MAJOR. Mitigation: never a false PASS — the harness fails safe to
  `unsupported`, so it under-reports coverage rather than over-reporting compliance.
- **Fix locus**: `src/Kappa/TestHarness.hs:175-185` (`structuredUnsupported`), `:292-293`
  (`runArgs`/`stdinFile`), and the §T.8 outcome logic at `:681-682`.

### 3. §4 unsafe/debug facilities entirely unrecognized — no §4.2 gating diagnostic (MAJOR)

- **§**: §4.1 (these forms "remain part of the language specification"), §4.2 ("Violations
  are compile-time errors. Diagnostics … MUST identify both the offending … form and the
  build setting … that disallows it").
- **Probe**: `/tmp/probe/at.kp` `assertTerminates let loop : Int = loop` →
  `error[E_EXPECTED_SYNTAX_TOKEN] … unexpected 'assertTerminates'` (generic parse error, not
  a §4.2 gating diagnostic). `assertReducible` likewise. `unsafeAssertProof` →
  `E_NAME_UNRESOLVED`. `unhide`/`clarify` parse (`Parser.hs:872`) but are never build-gated
  (no `allow_*` in src).
- **Expected vs actual**: spec requires these to be recognized forms that, in package mode
  (defaults all false), produce a gating diagnostic naming the form and the `allow_*` setting.
  Actual = generic parse/resolve error (`assertTerminates`/`assertReducible`/
  `unsafeAssertProof`) or silent ungated acceptance (`unhide`/`clarify`).
- **Severity**: MAJOR (no clause makes §4 optional; it is classified unsafe/debug but still
  "part of the language specification"). The `unhide`/`clarify` *silent ungated acceptance*
  is the worst part — a package-mode default-false setting is not enforced.
- **Fix locus**: lexer/parser keyword recognition for `assertTerminates`/`assertReducible`/
  `assertTotal` decl prefixes (`src/Kappa/Parser.hs`), a build-config record with the §4.2
  `allow_*` fields, and gating checks in `src/Kappa/Check.hs`/`Resolve.hs`.

### 4. §T.5.1 numeric diagnostic codes not rejected (MINOR)

- **§**: §T.5.1 ("Purely numeric codes are not valid standard-harness diagnostic codes") +
  §T.3 (ill-typed directive argument = harnessError).
- **Probe**: `/tmp/ht/num.kp` `assertDiagnostic error 12345` → **FAIL**, not HARNESS-ERROR.
- **Expected vs actual**: should be `harnessError` (ill-typed code argument); actual = treated
  as a valid code and evaluated, would false-PASS if such a code existed.
- **Severity**: MINOR. **Fix locus**: validate `<code>` shape in `parseDirective`
  (`src/Kappa/TestHarness.hs`, `withSevCode`/`ADiag*` construction).

### 5. §T.6 duplicate-config-key conflict only detected for `mode` (MINOR)

- **§**: §T.6 ("If the same configuration key is specified more than once with different
  values, the suite is ill-formed").
- **Probe**: `/tmp/ht/conf.kp` `dumpFormat json` + `dumpFormat sexpr` → **PASS** (should be
  ill-formed / harnessError).
- **Expected vs actual**: ill-formed suite; actual = PASS. Only `mode` is conflict-checked
  (`TestHarness.hs:679`).
- **Severity**: MINOR. **Fix locus**: generalize the dedup check in `runSuiteWith`
  (`src/Kappa/TestHarness.hs:679`) to all config keys (dumpFormat/backend/scriptMode).

### 6. §T.2 nested directory not treated as one directory suite (MINOR)

- **§**: §T.2 ("Directory suite: A directory containing one or more `.kp` source files …").
- **Probe**: under the recursive walk (`runTestPathAt False`), a nested dir of `.kp` files
  without `suite.ktest`/`main.kp` is run as independent single-file tests, not compiled
  together as one suite root (`src/Kappa/TestHarness.hs:1773-1793`, `isSuiteRoot`).
- **Expected vs actual**: spec = one directory suite; actual = a collection of single-file
  tests. Correct when invoked with `--suite` or when a `suite.ktest`/`main.kp` is present.
- **Severity**: MINOR (driver convenience-layer divergence; suite semantics themselves are
  correct). **Fix locus**: `isSuiteRoot`/`runTestPathAt` directory-walk policy.

## Profile-scoped / intentionally-unsupported (cited)

- **§4.6 backend-specific surface escapes** — conditional ("If an implementation provides
  such a facility"); none provided ⇒ conforming.
- **§24 / §25 / §26 dynamics, boundary contracts, FFI, bridges** — governed by foreign
  boundaries the pure interpreter does not cross; §1.1 boundary honesty applies only when a
  foreign connection exists; §36.28/§36.30 host-binding/bridge surfaces are build-system
  profile-scoped. Appendix O frames graduality as roadmap.
- **§27.1–27.6 backend & runtime-capability profiles** — §27.7 makes each backend profile
  independently conforming; interpretation is a sanctioned execution strategy. No code
  generator required for a conforming language implementation.
- **§34.1.6A conformance-verification mode; §34.3 KBackendIR / target lowering** —
  compiler-pipeline / backend machinery; backend IR profile-scoped under §27.7.
  (Caveat: §34.1.3-§34.1.7 stage-dump *observability* is called "ordinary required tooling"
  by §4.1 — see gap #2's §T.5.3 facet; the dump *content* is profile-scoped but the harness
  directive handling is not.)
- **§35 config mode** — separate evaluation mode selected by role/extension/flag/API
  (§35 intro); not part of the ordinary check/run pipeline.
- **§36 build system** — separate package/build tool layer; the language implementation
  (check/run/test) does not require it; host bindings/bridges/publish are profile-scoped.
- **§37 IDE/LSP profiles** — §37.3 explicitly divides IDE support into conformance profiles
  (Tooling Core / First-Class / Broad-Compat / Syntax-Only); shipping no LSP server is
  profile-scoped. (Caveat: §37.3.1's "machine-readable structured diagnostics" reinforces
  gap #1, which is anchored at the CORE §3.1.1, not at §37.)
- **Appendix-T §T.7 incremental step suites + `stageDumps` capability** — §T.4 lists
  `incremental`/`stageDumps` as optional capabilities; unmet `requires capability` → §T.8
  `unsupported`. Defensible *when gated by `requires`* (the un-gated downgrade is gap #2).
